                They left Denmark to come to the United States in 1861. They crossed the Atlantic Ocean on a sailing vessel. It took them six weeks. It ws the last trip the old ship ever made. They joined a company of Saints in Winter Quarters, Nebraska where Niel Kyeldseon Jensen took ill, died and was buried there. Great-grandmother Karen Jensen went on with them to Fountin Green, Utah where she lived for several years. She died and was buried there.

                They arrived in Utah in 1865 where they settled in Foutain Green. Grandfather farmed and worked as a shoemaker. He also fought the Indians. He was wounded in the right arm by an arrow which bothered him very much. He would work with a cycle all day and walk the floor as his arm hurt him so much.

                They lived in Fountian Green for several years. Then President Brigham Young called them with a company of covered wagans to settle in Colorado as missionaries. They sold their home and farm and put their furnitre in covered wagons and drove across the desert. They saw lots of Indians, but were never bothered by them. They were always afraid they might. They had a hard time getting across the Platte River. It was high and the wagons went down stream. My mother drove one of the wagons part of the way. My father was one of the scouts when he was a young man. They settled in Sanford, Colorado where they had a nice brick house built. Grandfather died in 1901 of dropsy at the age of 67,
